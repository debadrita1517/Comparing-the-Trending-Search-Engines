## **Browser Wars(1995) :**

### **In the mid 1990s, the First Browser War began with Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer fighting for dominance. By 2001, Internet Explorer was the clear winner, but it was not long before the Second Browser Wars began (2004-2017). This coincided with the rise of smartphones, which emphasized the need and competitiveness for more mobile-friendly versions of browsers.**

### **In this notebook, we'll analyze the worldwide popularity of browsers over time using Google Trends. Although this won't give us direct market share figures, we can use Google Trends to get a sense of interest of a given browser over time and how that interest compares to other browsers. In particular, we will be looking at five major players over the past two decades: Mozilla Firefox (2002-), Apple's Safari (2002-), Google Chrome (2008-), Microsoft Internet Explorer (1995-2020), and Opera (1995-).**
